# Overview
Project 1 will feature a portfolio of my experience and works. It will be a static site with a responsive, mobile-friendly design. I am a creative alongside a computer scientist. As a result, the site will feature 3 long pages, not counting the cover page.

# Goals
The goal of the portfolio site is to inform any viewer that I am competent in my craft. This is done by displaying my history of completed works and professional affiliations. To sprinkle in something out of the ordinary, I also aim to feature my flag designs and the contexts they appeared in to show my creative ability and social activity. Another goal would be to fine-tune this project to the point that I can host it for personal reasons outside of the context of the class.

# Target Users

## Potential Employer
My portfolio site should be impressive enough to keep the attention of a Potential Employer. Knowing that employers read resumes in seconds to a couple minutes, the portfolio site should cater to the employer by being extremely user-friendly and easy to read in seconds. It would be the greatest sin to fill the site with an abundance of text and superfluous buttons as to risk the employer losing interest in my site. The best way to tackle this is to make a glorified, interactive bullet list for each page. The employer would be able to quickly scroll through one page and read the important blurbs and headings in seconds. In the case that an employer wishes to see more about a heading or blurb, they should be able to click somewhere to expand the blurb into a full paragraph to read. This way, it caters to employers who can only spare seconds and employers who can take their time reading something interesting.

# Content

## Cover Page
This will be the smallest page: just my name, face, title, and some flashy hook like a logo, animation, or little website magic. At the top will be a nav bar to allow the user to explore the other 3 pages.

## First Page: Experience
This page will be reminiscient of a resume in which I list my professional history such as my former employers and my internships.
## Second Page: Projects
Projects should be the meat of my site. A handful of my professional and creative projects will be detailed and accomodated with images.
## Third Page: Flag Design
Something quirky would be to feature my flags that I designed for various contexts. Unlike the second page, this one will be mostly images rather than text.

# Similar Sites
A [co-worker's portfolio page](https://tianshu-z.github.io/) is a minimalistic version of what I imagined. It features a navbar for a handful of pages, similar to my plan. It also features a chronological history of the person's works, what I wish to mimic in the First Page of my project.

Another [co-worker's portfolio page](http://www.thisisntme.com/home.html) features an extremely interesting home page as it contains an animation of stars and his name in the corner. Something that can captivate my attention as much as this home page can would be ideal for my cover page.
